# DETER
DETER is a system that can replay the execution of TCP connections. See our [NSDI 19 paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi19/presentation/li-yuliang).

It requires a few modification to the Linux kernel to support. We made modifications to Linux 4.4.98 [here](https://github.com/harvard-cns/deter_kernel_4.4.98).
